    "# Introduction\n",
    "Heart disease, or cardiovascular disease, refers to conditions affecting the heart, often involving narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack. Both men and women face increased risk with age. High cholesterol can lead to fatty deposits in blood vessels, increasing the risk of blockages and heart attacks. Men tend to have a higher risk at a younger age compared to women. We aim to classify patients' likelihood of heart disease using age, sex, and cholesterol.\n",

    "The dataset we will be using will be the Hungary Heart Disease database (“reprocessed. Hungarian.data”); a data set intended to determine the presence of heart disease in patients of Hungary. It contains data on 14 variables, including age, sex, etc. "
