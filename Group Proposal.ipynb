    "Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and the term is often used interchangeably with \"cardiovascular disease,\" which generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack. Heart disease is also a leading cause of death globally, one in five deaths in the U.S. is caused by heart disease and heart disease cost the U.S. 239.9 billion dollars each year. There are many risk factors that directly associates with the presence of heart diease in patients, such as age and sex. With that said, the goal for us today is to classify patients with or without heart disease by distinguishing the likelihood using the risk factors. The dataset we will be using to perform this process on will be the 1988 Hungary Heart Disease database. "
